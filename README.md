Premise: Play a game of No Limit Texas Hold em. Bet money and 
beat your opponents hand to get their money and win! Get 200 points to win. The computer will move after a 3 second delay after your move.

## User Story
This is my attempt of expressing the love for my hobbies in my coding projects. It was incredibly challenging and I've realized my love for the backend logic engineering and my hatred for anthing related to frontend. It was fun trying to manipulate and access the numerous object keys and values and I love dealing with the seemingly infinite amount of edge cases that can occur when you try to only look at 5 out of 7 cards with differing values and suits. 

As a user I want to
* See the 2 given cards
* Bet money, call, or fold 
* Decide whether or not to play given 2 cards
* Have buttons disabled after winning

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (logic and DOM manipulation)
